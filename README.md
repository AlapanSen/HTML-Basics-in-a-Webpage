# HTML-Basics-in-a-Webpage
Hey everyone,this is my small contribution of making multiple webpages which has all the basics of html performed in it.Anyone can read the code and understand the function of the typical html syntax.

This project is a combination of multiple webpages,so I request you to clone this repository and run it using vss and the live server extension for full and easier understanding.

Thank You.
